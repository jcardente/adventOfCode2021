# Solutions for Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for the
[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com) competition. 

I mainly participate in Advent of Code for fun. Last [year](https://github.com/jcardente/adventOfCode2020), I also
used the competition to improve my skills in an unfamiliar language, [Julia](https://julialang.org/). 
However, for AoC2021, I decided to keep simple and use Python3. However, my goal is to use as few packages as possible.

Each directory contains the code and a writeup for my solution to that day's puzzle.
